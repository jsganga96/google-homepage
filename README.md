Before the project begins:

Oh boy I hope this goes well!!!!

Post-project:

This was an introductory project to have me utilizate HTML and CSS in order to replicate an existing page. It made me think about the different elements that go into making a responsive webpage, such as making buttons/inputs have a shadow when the user hovers over them.

Possible improvements; cleaning up CSS and making it a little more compact.

Hardest part: Getting the icons to cleanly display in the search bar.
